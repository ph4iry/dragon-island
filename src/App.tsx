                      BLA students tend to prefer to apply to schools in state, with <span className="font-bold bg-amber-200">23/30 schools (76.7%)</span> being in Massachusetts

                    <div className="mt-2">
                      The largest difference between publicly-posted and internal acceptance rates at BLA (excluding Northeastern) is located at <span className="bg-amber-200"><span className="font-bold">Penn State</span> (82%, up 26% from the national rate)</span>! This is particularly interesting because it's a public university in <span className="italic">Pennsylvania</span>, not Massachusetts.
                    </div>
                    <div className="mt-2">
                      Based on this data, it is <span className="bg-amber-200">SLIGHTLY easier to get into Northeastern (43%) than UMass Amherst (42%)</span> from BLA. It's only 1 percent, but it's nonetheless surprising given the fact that Northeastern is a private university, and it's posted acceptance rate is much lower than the one reflected here.

              <p className="text-base">Since the removal of nearly all honors courses from the BLA course catalog, there has instead been a shift towards permitting students to take more college-level AP coursework. However, this has resulted in gradually more competitive classes every year.</p>

                Something beyond just the numbers, however, is the fact that the class of 2025 is the first class to have experienced the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in a significant shift in the way students learn and interact with each other, and has also resulted in a significant shift in the way students are evaluated by colleges. Additionally, the lowest GPA in the class of 2025 is a 1.67 (equating to a C-), which is the highest it has been in recent years.

              <p>The conclusions that can be drawn from this college admissions data is still indefinite; a lot of interesting questions regarding admissions at top-20 institutions are left unanswered, as well as unstandardized high schools makes it difficult to compare to the other two exam schools. However, this serves as a base point for additional discoveries.
                
                <br /><br />In the future, there will be more data added; in the meantime, this will make do due to a lack of graphs and such. Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for updates!</p>
